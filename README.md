# 0,1 Knapsack problem

Course project for CSI 4105 - Design Analysis Algorithms II (Fall 2021).\
Implementing two algorithms for solving the NP-Complete 0-1 Knapsack problem.

## Algorithms
1. Dynamic Programming solution (With simple backtracking to find the solution).
2. FPTAS (Full polynomial time approximation scheme) using Dynamic programming
3. Something I have not decided yet...
## Implementation

**TODO:**
* Build test inputs.
* Make verbose for printing the time of completion, etc... 
* Create verifiable solution set. 
* Complete the dynamic programming implementation.
* Implement second mystery algorithm.
